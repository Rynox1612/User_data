# RESTful API Project (In Progress) 🚧

## 📌 Overview

This is a **RESTful API-based project** that is currently under development.  
The API is designed to manage and store data for multiple users.
While the backend structure is still evolving, the core functionalities around user data storage and interaction are being actively worked on.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** MySQL (used for storing user data)  
- **Templating Engine:** EJS  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (with ChatGPT assistance for initial design ideas)

## 💡 Features (Implemented So Far)

- Created a RESTful API structure for handling users.
- Integrated MySQL to securely store user data.
- Used **static HTML** designs and converted them into **dynamic EJS templates**.
- Modular routing and API setup for scalability.
- 🔐 **Note:** Database credentials and sensitive configuration code have been removed from this repository to maintain privacy.

## 🙌 Special Thanks

This project was greatly enhanced with the help of **ChatGPT** in building HTML/CSS components and getting helpful suggestions during development.
